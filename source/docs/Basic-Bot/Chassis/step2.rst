Instructions
------------

- Align the 192mm U-Channel with the 432mm U-Channel as shown in the picture on the right.
- Using 4 M3 x 10mm BHCS, screw the 432mm U-Channel into the End Piece Plate on the 192mm U-Channel, as shown in the left picture. M3 BHCS requires the 2mm Hex Key (Pink).
- Do not fully tighten the screws yet. They should be loose so the chassis can be straightened later. 
- Repeat the process for the other three End Piece Plates connected to the 432mm U-Channel.
- Once everything is together, use the flattest surface to make all 4 channels as flat as possible.
- With all the channels flat and square to your liking, all 16 M3 x 10mm BHCS can be fully tightened. **Remember to use a star pattern when tightening to get even torque**
