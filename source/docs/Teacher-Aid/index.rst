Teacher Instruction Aid
=======================

*FIRST®* Robotics Canada introduces: **FTC Class Pack "Getting Started" Guide for Teachers** - Helping teachers to get started through the Provincial FTC Class Pack program. The goal is to provide teachers and students with easy entry to STEM robotics through our "getting started activity" based on the Class Pack Kit to build two simple robots instead of one advanced robot. 
Here is a `complete list of parts and basic instructions <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iSm7xrVOEM8tcmz_O8AB4qWoo8Ofc0GA/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=101062150750190031750&rtpof=true&sd=true>`__ for the teacher and students for building a T-bot in 3-4 hours of class time. This activity allows teachers to introduce students to an incredible STEM Advanced Robot Kit. It provides enough equipment to engage groups of 6 students, split into pairs to quickly build and operate a robot. Each class receives five robot kits, which can be used to build two T-bots for each group. A Time Challenge game activity follows the activity.

Key Points:
-----------

1) Overview of T-bot and extension activities/robots below are intended for in-class.
2) *FIRST®* Canada educational staff have worked to double the number of robots built when initially engaging their students with the FTC Class Pack. 
3) The activities can be organized to fit easily into the period length of time for both elementary and secondary students.
4) The structure of the T-bot introductory robot building activity focuses on getting the teacher and students started quickly to build two robots per kit in less than 4 hours of class time. Students thereby experience the build phase, adding a robot control system phase and operating/practice driving/operating phase where students quickly can see and experience the excitement of STEM in their classrooms.
5) Key to the T-bot is to actively engage every student in the class in **Hands-On Learning, working collaboratively as a team** in each group and each sub-group to contribute to building and operating the robots. 
6) **Teachers can be flexible** when each part of the activities is delivered in 30-minute or 76-minute classes, serving both elementary and secondary school students.
7) **Extension activities** are added with all the robot activities to provide **meaningful learning for all learner levels** regardless of their prior knowledge and experience.
