Instructions
------------

- Align the 96mm U-Channel with the 240mm U-Channel as shown below.
- Using M3 x 10mm SHCS, screw the 240mm U-Channel into the End Piece Blocks on the 96mm U-Channel. **Do not fully tighten the screws**
- Once all 16 screws have been put in, square up the frame so that everything is straight and level. 
- Fully tighten all screws using a star pattern.
