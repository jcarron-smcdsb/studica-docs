# Studica Docs
 SR FTC Docs


 Local Build Instructions
 ========================

 Follow the instructions below to build the docs locally.

 Requirements
 ------------
 * [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 
 Once Python is installed run the following command  
 `pip install -r source/requirements.txt`

 Building
 --------

 Auto builder is the best solution to building the docs.  
 Run `make autobuild` in the root project folder.  
 This will create a live server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or `localhost:8000`
